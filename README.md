# Perl 7: The up-to-date Perl

![](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25326498?v=3&s=200)

## FUNCTIONS

### `ðŸ’¬` `U+1F4AC`

```
    ðŸ’¬ 'Hello, World!'
```

Prints text to STDOUT adding a newline at the end.

## VARIABLES

Unlike previous Perls, Perl 7 no longer has sigils on variables nor do they
need any declarators and are simply declared on first use:

```
    a â‰” 2.4
    b â‰” âˆ’2.5
    ðŸ’¬ a Ã— b Ã— b # 15
    b â‰” 42
    ðŸ’¬ a Ã— b Ã— b # 4233.6
```

## OPERATORS

**Note:** Perl 7 fully embraces the entire Unicode range and so traditional
symbols that are mis-used in other languages (e.g. `*` for multiplication) are
no longer valid.

The currently supported operators are:

- `â‰”` `U+2254` assignment operator
- `Ã—` `U+00D7` Multiply
- `Ã·` `U+00F7` Divide
- `âˆ’` `U+2212` Subtract
- `+` `U+002B` Add
- `<` `U+003C` numerically less-than
- `>` `U+003E` numerically more-than
- `â‰¤` `U+2264` numerically less-than or equal-to
- `â‰¥` `U+2265` numerically more-than or equal-to
- `â‰ ` `U+2260` numerically not equal to
- `=` `U+003D` numerically equal to

## USER DECLARED FUNCTIONS

Functions in Perl 7 are trivial to declare and need no ugly braces or anything
like that. They're started with word `fun` followed by
space and the function's name, followed by function's body, followed by word
`ion`. Mnemonic: **fun**ct**ion**

```
fun greet
    ðŸ’¬ hi
ion
```

To call the function later, simply write its name:

```
greet  # prints "hi"
```

You can specify parameters with square brackets:

```
fun calc-it[a, b, c]
    ðŸ’¬ a + b + c
ion
calc-it[10, 20, 12] # prints 42
```
