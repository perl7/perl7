# Perl 7: The up-to-date Perl

![](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25326498?v=3&s=200)

## FUNCTIONS

### `ðŸ’¬`

```
    ðŸ’¬ 'Hello, World!'
```

Prints text to STDOUT adding a newline at the end.

## OPERATORS

B<Note:> Perl 7 fully embraces the entire Unicode range and so traditional
symbols that are mis-used in other languages (e.g. `*` for multiplication) are
no longer valid.

The currently supported operators are:

- `Ã—` `U+00D7` Multiply
- `Ã·` `U+00F7` Divide
- `âˆ’` `U+2212` Subtract
- `+` `U+002B` Add
